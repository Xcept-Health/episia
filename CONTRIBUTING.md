## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub and follow these steps:

1. **Search** existing issues to see if the bug has already been reported.
2. Use a **clear and descriptive title**.
3. Provide **step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the problem.
4. Describe your **environment** (OS, Python version, dependency versions).

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements! Please open an issue with:

- If relevant, **references** to existing work (papers, other implementations).

### Submitting a Pull Request

We love pull requests (PRs)! Here’s how to proceed:

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-perclos`, `fix/correct-ear-calculation`).
2. **Implement** your changes following the coding conventions (see below).
3. **Test** your changes thoroughly (add tests if needed).
4. **Document** your changes (update docstrings, the documentation if applicable).
5. **Push** your branch to your fork and open a pull request against `main`.
6. In the PR description, clearly explain:
   - What changes you made
   - Why they are necessary
   - How to test them (if not obvious)
7. Link the PR to any related issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
